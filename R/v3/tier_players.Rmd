This page list statistics of players' battles at **tier `r tier.roman` during update `r update`**.

## Current WR vs. Career Battles played

This graph shows players WR at the tier `r tier.roman` during the update `r update` vs. players' career battles.

```{r fig_career_battles_vs_current_WR, message = FALSE}
x_name <- "Battles"
y_name <- "WR"
fill_name <- "WR"
title <- "Current WR by Career Battles"

res <- stats.tier[, .(
  "WR" = first(WR.update),
  "Battles" = first(battles.career.all)
),
by = account_id
][, .N, by = .(
  Battles = cut(Battles,
    breaks = buckets.battles.career,
    include.lowest = TRUE
  ),
  WR = cut(WR,
    breaks = buckets.WR,
    include.lowest = TRUE
  )
)][order(Battles, WR)]

x_labels <- auto_range_format(buckets.battles.career)
fill_labels <- percent_range_format(buckets.WR)

plot_marimekko(res, title, update,
  x_name = "Battles", fill_var = "WR", palette.fill = palette.WN8,
  x_labels = x_labels, fill_labels = fill_labels, tier = tier
)
```

## Battles per Player

Number of battles fought per player during the update `r update`.

```{r fig_tier_battle_count_histogram}
res <- stats.tier[, .(Battles = sum(battles)), by = account_id]

if (tier > 5) {
  x_breaks <- seq(0, 1000, 100)
  bin_breaks <- seq(0, 1000, 25)
} else {
  x_breaks <- seq(0, 500, 50)
  bin_breaks <- seq(0, 500, 25)
}

plot_histogram(res, "Battles played at tier per Player", update,
  x_name = "Battles", y_name = "Share of Players %",
  bin_breaks = bin_breaks, x_signif = 2,
  y_pct = TRUE, y_signif = 2, x_breaks = x_breaks, mean = TRUE, tier = tier
)

s <- stats.tier[, .(Battles = sum(battles)),
  by = account_id
][, .(
  mean = mean(Battles),
  median = median(Battles),
  max = max(Battles)
)]
```

On average, players played `r as.integer(s$mean)` battles. Median was `r s$median` and the largest number of battles recorded by a single player (in the dataset) during the update `r update` was `r auto_format(s$max, digits = 10, no_sfx=TRUE)` battles. The following tables shows battle counts by N% most inactive players during the update.

### Battles per Player table

The table below shows the (max) number of battles played during `r update` by the X% most _inactive_ players. A reading tip: 10% most _active_ players played more than the 90% most _inactive_ players.

{{% expand "Show table" %}}
```{r tier_battle_count_summary, echo = FALSE}
md_table_histogram(
  stats.tier[, .(Battles = sum(battles)),
    by = account_id
  ][, Battles],
  "Battles",
  breaks = buckets.battles,
  lims = c(0, 1000)
)
```

## Player WR distribution

### Players with `r min_battles.tier`+ battles in maxed-out tanks

The following graph shows a histogram of players (y-axis) with certain WR during the update `r update` (x-axis). This graph includes all the players who have played more than `r min_battles.tier` battles during the update.

```{r fig_tier_player_WR_histogram}
res <- stats.tier.perf[, .(
  WR = first(WR.tier.maxed),
  Battles = first(battles.tier.maxed)
),
by = account_id
][Battles > min_battles.tier]
title <- get_plot_title_subtitle("Player WR distribution", "Active players, maxed-out tanks")
plot_histogram(res, title,
  update,
  x_name = "WR", y_name = "Share of Players",
  x_lims = c(0, 1), x_step = 0.1, x_pct = TRUE,
  y_pct = TRUE, y_steps = 10, y_signif = 2, bins = 100, tier = tier
)
```

{{% expand "Show table" %}}
```{r tier_player_WR_histogram, echo = FALSE}
md_table_histogram(
  stats.tier.perf[, .(WR = first(WR.tier.maxed)),
    by = account_id
  ][, WR],
  "WR",
  breaks = seq(0, 1, 0.01),
  lims = c(.2, .85)
)
```
{{% /expand %}}

### Player WR distribution (all players)

The following graph shows a histogram of players (y-axis) with certain WR during the update `r update` (x-axis). This graph includes all the players who have played during the update, even a single game. Therefore there are peaks around 25%, 33%, 50%, 67% and 75% and players with 0% or 100% WR.

```{r fig_tier_player_WR_histogram_unfiltered}
res <- stats.tier[, .(
  WR = first(WR.tier.all),
  Battles = first(battles.tier.all)
),
by = account_id
]

title <- get_plot_title_subtitle("Player WR distribution", "All players")


plot_histogram(res, title, update,
  x_name = "WR", y_name = "Share of Players",
  x_lims = c(0, 1), x_step = 0.1, x_pct = TRUE,
  y_pct = TRUE, y_steps = 10, y_signif = 2, bins = 100, tier = tier
)
```

## Average damage distribution

The following graph shows a histogram of players' average damage. Y-axis shows the share of players (%) with certain certain average damage during the update `r update` (x-axis). This graph includes all the players who have played more than `r min_battles.tier` battles with a maxed-out tank during the update.

```{r fig_tier_player_avg_dmg_histogram}
res <- stats.tier[battles.tier.maxed > min_battles.tier,
  .(
    "Average Damage" = first(avg_dmg.tier.maxed),
    Battles = first(battles.tier.maxed)
  ),
  by = account_id
]

title <- get_plot_title_subtitle(
  "Player Average Damage distribution",
  "Active players, Maxed-out tanks"
)

plot_histogram(res, title, update,
  x_name = "Average Damage", y_name = "Share of Players",
  x_quantiles = list(NULL, .999),
  x_pct = FALSE,
  y_pct = TRUE, y_steps = 10, y_signif = 2,
  bins = 100, tier = tier
)
```

{{% expand "Show table" %}}
```{r tier_player_avg_dmg_histogram, echo = FALSE}
x_breaks <- get_breaks(0, quantile(res$`Average Damage`, .9999, na.rm = TRUE), steps = 20)
x_breaks <- x_breaks$breaks

md_table_histogram(res$`Average Damage`, "Average Damage",
  breaks = x_breaks
)
```
{{% /expand %}}


## Average Damage + kills per battle vs. WR

```{r fig_tier_WR_vs_avg_dmg_kpb}
x_name <- "Average Damage"
y_name <- "Kills/Battle"
z_name <- "WR"
res <- stats.tier[battles.tier.maxed > min_battles.tier,
  .(
    "Average Damage" = first(avg_dmg.tier.maxed),
    "Kills/Battle" = mean(avg_kills),
    "WR" = first(WR.tier.maxed),
    "Battles" = first(battles.tier.maxed)
  ),
  by = account_id
]

title <- get_plot_title_subtitle(
  "WR vs. Average Damage + Kills per Battle",
  "Active players, Maxed-out tanks, Tier average"
)

plot_contour_discrete(res, title, update,
  x_name, y_name, z_name,
  weights = "Battles",
  col.palette = palette.WN8,
  col.levels = buckets.WR,
  tier = tierN
)
```


## Share of Battles per Nation per Vehicle Class

This chart shows share of battles per nation per vehicle class at tier `r tier.roman`.

```{r fig_tier_battles_nation_vehicle_class}
y_name <- "Battles"
x_name <- "Nation"
fill_name <- "Vehicle Class"
title <- get_plot_title_share_of_by_by(y_name, x_name, fill_name)
res <- stats.tier[, .(N = sum(battles)),

    Nation = nation,
    "Vehicle Class" = type
  )

```

## Player WR per Nation

```{r fig_tier_WR_per_nation}
res <- stats.tier[battles.tier.maxed > min_battles.tier,
