## The Best Performing Tanks

### Highest Relative WR

The graph shows the tanks with the highest _Relative WR_. That is the average of players' WR in a tank compared to their average WR at the tier (in all same tier tanks). Relative WR is a measure of the performance/strength of the tank.

{{% expand "Show details" %}}
* All the statistics are about battles fought during the update `r update` only.
* The impact of "Stock-grind battles" is reduced based on tier-specific requirement for total battles at the end of the update. Only players with more than `r floor(min(min_battles.grinds))`-`r floor(max(min_battles.grinds))` (depending on the tier) battles in a tank _in the end of the update_ are included to eliminate the impact of the first battles in the tank (with sub-100% crew / modules).
* The players need to have `r min(min_battles.tanks)`-`r max(min_battles.tanks)` battles in a tank and `r min(min_battles.tiers)`-`r max(min_battles.tiers)` battles at the tier during the update.
* **Average WR** is the players's average WR in the tank
* **Player WR at Tier** is the average WR of the players of the tank at the tier. Since different tiers have different difficulty, it is more meaningful to compare players' performance in the same tier tanks.

## Lowest Average WR

This graph shows the tanks with the lowest average WR at tier `r tier.roman` during update `r update`. **Player WR** denotes the tank's players' average WR across all the tanks during the update. Only tanks with more than `r min_players.tank` players are listed. This may filter out few upcoming tanks that are being tested.

#### Lowest Average WR - Table

**Average WR** denotes average WR in a tank across all the players during the update. **Player WR** denotes the tank's players' average WR across all the tanks during the update.
