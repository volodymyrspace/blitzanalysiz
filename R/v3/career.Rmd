`r update_if_final(update, '', '_Preliminary stats_')`

```{r career_info, echo = FALSE}
res <- stats.career[, .(Battles = first(battles.career.all)),
  by = account_id
]
players <- nrow(res)
```

This page shows statistics of players' battles fought during their Blitz "career" until the end of **update `r update`**. 
In total, `r auto_format(players)` players played during update `r update`.

## Battles per Player

Number of career/cumulative battles per player in the end of the update `r update`.

```{r fig_career_battle_count_histogram}
plot_histogram(res, "Career Battles per Players", update,
  "Battles", "Share of Players %",
  x_lims = c(0, 100e3), x_step = 5000, y_step = 2.5 / 100, x_signif = 2,
  y_pct = TRUE, y_signif = 2
)

res <- res[, .(mean = mean(Battles), median = median(Battles), max = max(Battles))]
```

An average player has played `r as.integer(res$mean)` battles by the end of update `r update`. 
Median battle count was `r res$median` and the largest number of battles recorded by a single 
player (in the dataset) was `r auto_format(res$max)` battles. The following tables shows battle 
counts by N% most inactive players during the update (i.e. "90% most inactive" == "10% most active"). 

### Battles per Player table

{{% expand "Show table" %}}

The table below shows the (max) number of battles played until the end of `r update` by the 
X% most _inactive_ players. Reading tip: 10% most _active_ players have played more than the 
90% most _inactive_ players.

```{r career_battle_count_summary, echo = FALSE}
md_table_quantiles(stats.career[, .(Battles = first(battles.career.all)),
  by = account_id
][, Battles], "Battles", c(seq(0, .9, .05), seq(.91, 1, 0.01)))
```
{{% /expand %}}

## Player WR distribution

The following graph shows a histogram of players (y-axis) based on their career WR (x-axis). 
Only players with `r min_battles.career` battles or more are included.

```{r fig_career_player_WR_histogram}
res <- stats.career[battles.career.all >= min_battles.career,
  .(WR = first(WR.career.all)),
  by = account_id
]
plot_histogram(res, "Player Career WR distribution", update,
  x_name = "WR", y_name = "Share of Players",
  x_lims = c(.2, .8), x_step = .05, x_pct = TRUE,
  y_pct = TRUE, y_step = .01, binwidth = .01
)
```

{{% expand "Show table" %}}
```{r career_player_WR, echo = FALSE}
h <- hist(stats.career[,
  .(WR = first(WR.career.all)),
  by = account_id
][, WR], breaks = 100, plot = FALSE)
sum.counts <- sum(h$counts)
h$density <- h$counts / sum.counts
h$cum <- cumsum(h$density)
len <- length(h$breaks)
res <- data.table(
  "Career WR" = h$breaks[2:len],
  "Share %" = h$density,
  "Cumulative share %" = h$cum
)[(`Career WR` >= .2) & (`Career WR` < .81)]
md_table(res)

## Current WR vs. Career Battles played

This graph shows Player WR during the update `r update` vs. player career battles. Average tier is not taken into account.

```{r fig_career_battles_vs_current_WR, message=FALSE}

## Average Tier

The following graph shows a histogram of share of players (y-axis) average tier (x-axis). Only players with more than `r min_battles.career` battles during their Blitz "career" are included.

```{r fig_career_player_avg_tier_histogram}
res <- stats.career[battles.career.all > min_battles.career,
