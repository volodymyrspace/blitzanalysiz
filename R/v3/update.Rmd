`r update_if_final(update, "", "_Preliminary stats_")`

Statistics of battles fought during **update `r update``r print_if(preliminary, " so far")`**.
All the stats (WR, damage, battles, etc.) refer to stats during the update, not career stats
unless otherwise mentioned. In total, there were `r auto_format(Battles)` battles by `r auto_format(Players)` players recorded.

## The Best Performing Tanks

### Highest Relative WR

The graph shows the tanks with the highest _Relative WR_. That is the average of players' WR in a tank compared to their average WR at the tier (in all same tier tanks). Relative WR is a measure of the performance/strength of the tank.

{{% expand "Show details" %}}
* All the statistics are about battles fought during the update `r update` only.
* The impact of "Stock-grind battles" is reduced based on tier-specific requirement for total battles at the end of the update. Only players with more than `r floor(min(min_battles.grinds))`-`r floor(max(min_battles.grinds))` (depending on the tier) battles in a tank _in the end of the update_ are included to eliminate the impact of the first battles in the tank (with sub-100% crew / modules).
* The players need to have `r min(min_battles.tanks)`-`r max(min_battles.tanks)` battles in a tank and `r min(min_battles.tiers)`-`r max(min_battles.tiers)` battles at the tier during the update.
* **Average WR** is the players's average WR in the tank
* **Player WR at Tier** is the average WR of the players of the tank at the tier. Since different tiers have different difficulty, it is more meaningful to compare players' performance in the same tier tanks.
* Only tanks with more than `r min_players.tank` players are listed. This may filter out few upcoming tanks that are being tested.

## Highest Average WR

This graph shows the tanks with the highest average WR during update `r update`. **Player WR** denotes the tank's players' average WR across all the tanks during the update.

{{% expand "Details" %}}
* Only battles in maxed-out tanks are taken into account. It is assumed that a tank is maxed out if it is a) premium tank or b) player has more than certain number of  battles in it in the end of the update (tier dependent: Tier I: 0 battles, Tier X: `r min_battles.grinds[10]` battles.
* Since the data is fetched once per update, the stats for just released new Tech-Tree tanks is lower than it should be since the battles  players ground the tanks from stock are included in the average.
* On the other hand new high tier tanks are often ground first by more active and also better players that distorts the average WR.
* Only tanks with more than `r min_players.tank` players are listed. This may filter out few upcoming tanks that are being tested.
