## The Best Performing Tanks

### Highest Relative WR

The graph shows tier [`r tier.roman`](..) `r tank_type`s by _Relative WR_. That is the average of players' WR in a 
tank compared to their average WR at the tier (in all same tier tanks). Relative WR is a measure of the performance/strength of the tank.

{{% expand "Show details" %}}
* All the statistics are about battles fought during the update `r update` only.
* The graph shows averages over all the player skill-levels. Well-armored tanks tend to do better in the hands of less-skilled players and thus those tanks tend to have higher (average) Relative WR even in the hands of skilled players those could do relatively worse.
* The impact of "Stock-grind battles" is reduced based on tier-specific requirement for total battles at the end of the update. Only players with more than `r floor(min(min_battles.grinds))`-`r floor(max(min_battles.grinds))` (depending on the tier) battles in a tank _in the end of the update_ are included to eliminate the impact of the first battles in the tank (with sub-100% crew / modules).
* The players need to have `r min(min_battles.tanks)`-`r max(min_battles.tanks)` battles in a tank and `r min(min_battles.tiers)`-`r max(min_battles.tiers)` battles at the tier during the update.
* **Average WR** is the players's average WR in the tank
* **Player WR at Tier** is the average WR of the players of the tank at the tier. Since different tiers have different difficulty, it is more meaningful to compare players' performance in the same tier tanks.
